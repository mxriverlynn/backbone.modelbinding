# Backbone.ModelBinding

Awesome model binding for [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone)

Inspired by [Brad Phelan](http://xtargets.com/2011/06/11/binding-model-attributes-to-form-elements-with-backbone-js/),
Knockout.js' data-binding capabilities, and [Brandon Satrom](http://userinexperience.com/?p=633)'s
desire to keep UJS alive. 

## Getting Started

It's easy to get up and running. You only need to have Backbone (including underscore.js - 
a requirement for Backbone) and jQuery in your page before including the backbone.modelbining
plugin.

### Prerequisites

* Backbone.js v0.5.1 or higher
* jQuery v1.6.2 or higher

This is a plugin for Backbone.js and is built and tested against Backbone v0.5.1. It also uses jQuery
to perform most of the bindng and manipulations, and is built and tested against v1.6.1. However, I am
currently using this plugin in a production application with Backbone v0.3.3 and jQuery v1.5.1. 

At this point, I make no guarantees of it working with any version of Backbone or jQuery, 
other than what it has been built and tested against. It works for me, so it may work for you
with versions other than what is stated

### Get The ModelBinding Plugin

Download the `backbone.modelbinding.js` file from this github repository and copy it into 
your javascripts folder. Add the needed `<script>` tag to bring the plugin into any page
that wishes to use it. Be sure to include the modelbinding file _after_ the backbone.js file.

### Render The ModelBindings

Your Backbone view must have an `el` defined and the `render` method of your view needs to 
execute the bindings that you define

````
SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: "#someElement",

  render: function(){
    // ... render your form here

    // execute the defined bindings
    Backbone.ModelBinding.call(this);
  }
});
````

## Convention Bindings

Automatic bi-directional binding between your form input and your model. 

The convention based binding requires no additional configuration or code in your
view, other than calling the `Backbone.ModelBinding.call(this);` as noted above.
With the conventions binding, your `<input>` fields will be bound to the views model
by the id of the input. 

For example:

````
// something.html

<input id='name'>

// something.js

SomeModel = Backbone.Model.extend();

SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function(){
    // ... render your form here

    // execute the defined bindings
    Backbone.ModelBinding.call(this);
  }
});

model = new SomeModel();
view = new SomeView({model: model});

model.set({name: "some name"});

````

In this example, when `model.set` is called to set the name, "some name" will appear
in the `#name` input field. Similarly, when the `#name` input field is changed, the
value entered into that field will be sent to the model's `name` attribute.

## Data-Bind Attributes

Backbone.ModelBinding supports Knockout-style data-bind attributes on any arbitrary
HTML element. These bindings will populate any attribute, the text, or HTML contents
of an HTML element based on your configurations. This is particularly useful when a
model that is being edited is also being displayed elsewhere on the screen.

To bind an element to a model's attributes, add a `data-bind` attribute to the element
and specify what should be updated with which model attribute using a `elementAttr modelAttr`
format. For example `<span data-bind="text name">` will update the span's text with
the model's name attribute, when the model's name changes.

````
<form>
  <input type="text" id="name">
</form>
Name: <span data-bind="text name">

SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  // ... 

  render: function(){
    // ... 
    Backbone.ModelBinding.call(this);
  }
});

someModel = new SomeModel();
someView = new SomeView({model: someModel});
````

In this example, the model's `name` will be updated when you type into the text box
and then tab or click away from it (to fire the change event). When the model's `name`
attribute is updated, the `data-bind` convention will pick up the change and set
the text of the `span` to the model's name.

## Form Binding Conventions

The following form input types are supported by the form convention binder:

* text
* textarea
* password
* checkbox
* select 
* radio button groups

Radio buttons are group are assumed to be grouped by the `name` attribute of the 
radio button items. 

Select boxes will populate 2 separate fields into the model that they are bound to.
The standard `#fieldid` will be populated with the selected value. An additional
`{#fieldid}_text` will be populated with the text from the selected item. For example,
a selected option of 

````
<select id='company'>
  <option value="foo_bar">Foo Bar Widgets, Inc.</option>
  ...
</select>
```` 

will populate the `company` attribute of the model with "foo_bar", and will populate
the `company_text` attribute of the model with "Foo Bar Widgets, Inc."

There is no support for hidden fields at the moment, because there is no 'change' event
that jQuery can listen to on a hidden field.

### Configuring The Bound Attributes

The convention binding system allows you to specify the attribute to use for the convention, by
the input type. The default configuration is:

```
{
  text: "id",
  textarea: "id",
  password: "id",
  radio: "name",
  checkbox: "id",
  select: "id"
}
````

You can override this configuration and use any attribute you wish, by specifying any or all of
these input types when you call the model binding. This is useful when you have field ids that
do not match directly to the model attributes. For example, the following will use a `modelAttr`
attribute value as the convention for text boxes.

````
SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function(){
    // ... some rendering here
    Backbone.ModelBinding.call(this, { text: "modelAttr" });
  }
});

<input type="text" id="the_model_name" modelAttr="name">
````

When this text box has it's value changed, the model's `name` attribute will be populated with
the value instead of `the_model_name`.

If the same convention needs to be used throughout an application, and not just withing a single
view, the configuration can be set at a global level:

````
Backbone.ModelBinding.Configuration.configureBindingAttributes({text: "modelAttr"});
````

Now all text boxes will update the model attribute specified in the text box's `modelAttr`.

## Pluggable Conventions

The convention based bindings are pluggable. Each of the existing form input types can have it's
convention replaced and you can add your own conventions for input types not currently handled,
etc. 

To replace a convention entirely, you need to supply a json document that has two pieces of
information: a jQuery selector string and an object with a `bind` method. Place the convention
in the `Backbone.ModelBinding.Conventions` and it will be picked up and executed. The `bind`
method receives three parameters: the jQuery selector you specified, the Backbone view, and
the model being bound.

You can replace the handler of an existing convention. For example, this will set the
value of a textbox called `#name` to some text, instead of doing any real binding.

````
var nameSettingsHandler = {
  bind: function(selector, view, model){
    view.$("#name").val("a custom convention supplied this name");
  }
};

Backbone.ModelBinding.Conventions.text.handler = nameSettingsHandler;
````

You can also create your own conventions that do just about anything you want. Here's an example
that modifies the contents of `<p>` tags:

````
var PConvention = {
  selector: "p",
  handler: {
    bind: function(selector, view, model){
      view.$(selector).each(function(index){
        var name = model.get("name");
        $(this).html(name);
      });
    }
  }
};

Backbone.ModelBinding.Conventions.paragraphs = PConvention;
````

This example will find all `<p>` tags in the view and render the `name` attribute from the model
into that paragraph, replacing all other text. Note that the name of the convention is set to
`paragraphs` when added to the conventions. This name did not exist prior to this assignment, so
the convention was added. If you assign a convention to an existing name, you will replace that
convention.

The list of existing conventions includes:
* text
* password
* radio
* checkbox
* select
* textarea
* formbinding
* databind
