# Backbone.ModelBinding

Convention-based, awesome model binding for [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone)

Inspired by [Brad Phelan](http://xtargets.com/2011/06/11/binding-model-attributes-to-form-elements-with-backbone-js/),
Knockout.js' data-binding capabilities, and [Brandon Satrom](http://userinexperience.com/?p=633)'s 
work with Knockout.

## Getting Started

It's easy to get up and running. You only need to have Backbone (including underscore.js - 
a requirement for Backbone) and jQuery in your page before including the backbone.modelbining
plugin.

### Prerequisites

* Backbone.js v0.5.1 or higher
* jQuery v1.6.2 or higher

This is a plugin for Backbone.js and is built and tested against Backbone v0.5.1. It also uses jQuery
to perform most of the bindng and manipulations, and is built and tested against v1.6.1. However, I am
currently using this plugin in a production application with Backbone v0.3.3 and jQuery v1.5.1. 

At this point, I make no guarantees of it working with any version of Backbone or jQuery, 
other than what it has been built and tested against. It works for me, so it may work for you
with versions other than what is stated

### Get The ModelBinding Plugin

Download the `backbone.modelbinding.js` file from this github repository and copy it into 
your javascripts folder. Add the needed `<script>` tag to bring the plugin into any page
that wishes to use it. Be sure to include the modelbinding file _after_ the backbone.js file.

### Model Binding

The model binding code is executed with a call to `Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(view)`. There are
several places that it can be called from, depending on your circumstances.

All of the element binding happens within the context of the view's `el`, therefore you must
call the model binding code after your view's `el` has been populated with the elements that
will be bound to.

#### Binding After Rendering

If your view modifies the html contents of the view's `el` in the `render` method, you should 
call the model binding after the modifications are made:

````
SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function(){
    // ... render your form here
    $(this.el).html("... some html and content goes here ... ");

    // execute the model bindings
    Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(this);
  }
});
````

#### Binding A View That Does Not Render

If, however, your view has an `el` that represents an existing element in your html, and the
contents of the `el` are not modified during a call to `render`, then you can make the call to
the model binding code in the initializer or anywhere else.

````
<form id="some-form">
  Name: <input id="name">
</form>
````

````
FormView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: "#some-form",

  initialize: function(){
    Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(this);
  }
});
````

#### Binding From Outside A View

There is no requirement for the model binding code to be called from within a view directly.
You can bind the view from external code, like this:

````
FormView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: "#some-form",
});

formView = new FormView();
Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(formView);
````

### Model Unbinding

When your view has completed its work and is ready to be removed from the DOM, you not only
need to unbnd your view's events (handled through the view's `remove` method, typically), you
also need to unbind the model events that are bound in the view. 

Backbone.ModelBinding can unbind its own events through a simple call to 
`Backbone.ModelBinding.unbind(view)`. If you do not call this method when your view is being
closed / removed / cleaned up, then you may end up with memory leaks and zombie views that
are still responding to model change events.

````
FormView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: "#some-form",

  initialize: function(){
    Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(this);
  },

  close: function(){
    this.remove();
    this.unbind();
    Backbone.ModelBinding.unbind(this);
  }
});
````

## Convention Bindings

Automatic bi-directional binding between your form input and your model. 

The convention based binding requires no additional configuration or code in your
view, other than calling the `Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(this);` as noted above.
With the conventions binding, your `<input>` fields will be bound to the views model
by the id of the input. 

For example:

````
// something.html

<input id='name'>

// something.js

SomeModel = Backbone.Model.extend();

SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function(){
    // ... render your form here

    // execute the defined bindings
    Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(this);
  }
});

model = new SomeModel();
view = new SomeView({model: model});

model.set({name: "some name"});

````

In this example, when `model.set` is called to set the name, "some name" will appear
in the `#name` input field. Similarly, when the `#name` input field is changed, the
value entered into that field will be sent to the model's `name` property.

## Data-Bind Attributes

Backbone.ModelBinding supports Knockout-style data-bind attributes on any arbitrary
HTML element. These bindings will populate any attribute, the text, or HTML contents
of an HTML element based on your configurations. This is particularly useful when a
model that is being edited is also being displayed elsewhere on the screen.

To bind an element to a model's properties, add a `data-bind` attribute to the element
and specify what should be updated with which model property using a `elementAttr modelAttr`
format. For example `<span data-bind="text name">` will update the span's text with
the model's name property, when the model's name changes.

````
<form>
  <input type="text" id="name">
</form>
Name: <span data-bind="text name">

SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  // ... 

  render: function(){
    // ... 
    Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(this);
  }
});

someModel = new SomeModel();
someView = new SomeView({model: someModel});
````

In this example, the model's `name` will be updated when you type into the text box
and then tab or click away from it (to fire the change event). When the model's `name`
property is updated, the `data-bind` convention will pick up the change and set
the text of the `span` to the model's name.

### Data-Bind Multiple Attributes

Multiple attributes can be specified for a single element's `data-bind` by separating
each with a `;` (semi-colon). For example:

````
<form>
  <input type="text" id="name">
</form>
Name: <span data-bind="text name; class name">

SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  // ... 

  render: function(){
    // ... 
    Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(this);
  }
});

someModel = new SomeModel();
someView = new SomeView({model: someModel});
````

In this example, both the text and the css class will be updated when you change
the name input. You can data-bind as many attributes as you need, in this manner.

### Special Cases For data-bind

There are several special cases for the data-bind attribute. These allow a little more
functionality than just setting an attribute on an element. 

* (default) - if you only specify the model property, defaults to the text of the html element
* text - replace the text contents of the element
* html - replace the html contents of the element
* enabled - enable or disable the html element

#### (default)

If you only specify the model's property in the data-bind attribute, then the data-bind
will bind the value of that model property to the `text` of the html element.

````
<div data-bind="name"/>
````

See the document for data-bind text, below.

#### text

If you set the data-bind attribute to use `text`, it will replace the text contents of the
html element instead of just setting an element attribute.

````
<div id="someDiv" data-bind="text someProperty"></div>


someModel.set({someProperty: "some value"});
````

#### html

If you set the data-bind attribute to use `html`, it will replace the entire
inner html of the html element, instead of just setting an element attribute.

````
<div id="someDiv" data-bind="html someProperty"></div>


someModel.set({someProperty: "some value"});
````

#### enabled

This special case breaks the html element standard of using a `disabled` attribute, specifically
to inver the logic used for enabling / disabling an element, to keep the data-bind attribute
clean and easy to read.

If you have a model with a property that indicates a negative state, such as `invalid`, then you
can use a data-bind attribute of `disabled`:

````
<button id="someButton" data-bind="disabled invalid"></div>


someModel.set({invalid: true});
````

However, some developers prefer to use positive state, such as `isValid`. In this case, setting
the disabled attribute to the model's isValid property would result in the button being disabled
when the model is valid and enabled when the model is not valid. To correct this, a special case
has been added to enable and disable an element with `enabled`.

````
<button id="someButton" data-bind="enabled isValid"></div>


someModel.set({isValid: false});
````

This will disable the button when the model is invalid and enable the button when the model is
valid.

#### displayed

This allows you to specify that an element should be shown or hidden by setting the css
of the element according to the value of the model properties specified.

````
<div data-bind="displayed isValid" />

someModel.set({isValid: false});
````

When the model's property is set to false, the HTML element's `display` css will be set
to `none`. When the model's property is set to true, the HTML element's `display` css
will be set to `block`.

#### hidden

This is the inverse of `displayed`.

````
<div data-bind="hidden isValid" />

someModel.set({isValid: true});
````

When the model's property is set to false, the HTML element's `display` css will be set
to `block`. When the model's property is set to true, the HTML element's `display` css
will be set to `none`.

### Data-Bind Substitutions

If a model's property is `unset`, the data-bind may not update correctly when using `text` or `html`
as the bound attribute of the element.

````
<div data-bind="text something"></div>

model.set({something: "whatever"});
model.unset("something");
````

The result will be a div with it's text set to "". this is handled through the data-bind's 
substitutions for undefined values. The default substitution is to replace an undefined
value with an empty string. However, this can be per attribute:

````
<div data-bind="text something"></div>
<div data-bind="html something"></div>

Backbone.ModelBinding.Configuration.dataBindSubst({
  text: "undefined. setting text to this",
  html: "&nbsp;"
});
model.set({something: "whatever"});
model.unset("something");
````

The result of this example will be a div that displays "undefined. setting the text to this" and a
div whose contents is a single space, instead of being empty.

## Form Binding Conventions

The following form input types are supported by the form convention binder:

* text
* textarea
* password
* checkbox
* select 
* radio button groups

Radio buttons are group are assumed to be grouped by the `name` attribute of the 
radio button items. 

Select boxes will populate 2 separate fields into the model that they are bound to.
The standard `#fieldid` will be populated with the selected value. An additional
`{#fieldid}_text` will be populated with the text from the selected item. For example,
a selected option of 

````
<select id='company'>
  <option value="foo_bar">Foo Bar Widgets, Inc.</option>
  ...
</select>
```` 

will populate the `company` property of the model with "foo_bar", and will populate
the `company_text` property of the model with "Foo Bar Widgets, Inc."

There is no support for hidden fields at the moment, because there is no 'change' event
that jQuery can listen to on a hidden field.

### Configuring The Bound Attributes

The convention binding system allows you to specify the attribute to use for the convention, by
the input type. The default configuration is:

```
{
  text: "id",
  textarea: "id",
  password: "id",
  radio: "name",
  checkbox: "id",
  select: "id"
}
````

You can override this configuration and use any attribute you wish, by specifying any or all of
these input types when you call the model binding. This is useful when you have field ids that
do not match directly to the model properties. 

#### Override All Element Binding Attributes

The following will use use the `class` attribute's value as the binding for all input field:

````
SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function(){
    // ... some rendering here
    Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(this, { all: "class" });
  }
});

<input type="text" id="the_model_name" class="name">
````

If the same convention needs to be used throughout an application, and not just withing a single
view, the configuration can be set at a global level:

````
Backbone.ModelBinding.Configuration.configureAllBindingAttributes("class");
````

#### Override Individual Element Binding Attributes

The following will use a `modelAttr` attribute value as the convention for text boxes, only.

````
SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function(){
    // ... some rendering here
    Backbone.ModelBinding.bind(this, { text: "modelAttr" });
  }
});

<input type="text" id="the_model_name" modelAttr="name">
````

When this text box has it's value changed, the model's `name` property will be populated with
the value instead of `the_model_name`.

If the same convention needs to be used throughout an application, and not just withing a single
view, the configuration can be set at a global level:

````
Backbone.ModelBinding.Configuration.configureBindingAttributes({text: "modelAttr"});
````

Now all text boxes will update the model property specified in the text box's `modelAttr`.

## Pluggable Conventions

The convention based bindings are pluggable. Each of the existing form input types can have it's
convention replaced and you can add your own conventions for input types not currently handled,
etc. 

To replace a convention entirely, you need to supply a json document that has two pieces of
information: a jQuery selector string and an object with a `bind` method. Place the convention
in the `Backbone.ModelBinding.Conventions` and it will be picked up and executed. The `bind`
method receives three parameters: the jQuery selector you specified, the Backbone view, and
the model being bound.

You can replace the handler of an existing convention. For example, this will set the
value of a textbox called `#name` to some text, instead of doing any real binding.

````
var nameSettingsHandler = {
  bind: function(selector, view, model){
    view.$("#name").val("a custom convention supplied this name");
  }
};

Backbone.ModelBinding.Conventions.text.handler = nameSettingsHandler;
````

You can also create your own conventions that do just about anything you want. Here's an example
that modifies the contents of `<p>` tags:

````
var PConvention = {
  selector: "p",
  handler: {
    bind: function(selector, view, model){
      view.$(selector).each(function(index){
        var name = model.get("name");
        $(this).html(name);
      });
    }
  }
};

Backbone.ModelBinding.Conventions.paragraphs = PConvention;
````

This example will find all `<p>` tags in the view and render the `name` property from the model
into that paragraph, replacing all other text. Note that the name of the convention is set to
`paragraphs` when added to the conventions. This name did not exist prior to this assignment, so
the convention was added. If you assign a convention to an existing name, you will replace that
convention.

The list of existing conventions includes:

* text
* password
* radio
* checkbox
* select
* textarea
* formbinding
* databind

For fully functional, bi-directional binding convention examples, check out the source code
to Backbone.ModelBinding in the `backbone.modelbinding.js` file.
